\label{cha:experiments}

\Autosectionref{sec:experimental-setup} of the \nameref{cha:experiments} chapter will describe the methodology and rationale behind the two experiments conducted in this thesis. The first experiment, presented in \autoref{subsec:benchmarking-setup}, assesses GeoGPT's abilities of solving common \acrshort{acr:gis} tasks through a new \enquote{\acrshort{acr:gis} benchmarking} dataset. The other experiment, presented in \autoref{subsec:prompt-quality-test-setup}, will assess the importance of the quality of the prompt passed from the user to GeoGPT. \Autosectionref{sec:datasets} lists the datasets used in the experiments. \Autosectionref{sec:experimental-results} presents the experimental results and offers interpretations of the findings from the experiments, and will also present several example results, including screenshots of the application and code that generated by GeoGPT.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental-setup}

\begin{comment}
Trying and failing is a major part of research. However, to have a chance of success you need a plan driving the experimental research, just as you need a plan for your literature search. Further, plans are made to be revised and this revision ensures that any further decisions made are in line with the work already completed.

The plan should include what experiments or series of experiments are planned and what questions the individual or set of experiments aim to answer. Such questions should be connected to your research questions, so that in the evaluation of your results you can discuss the results wrt to the research questions.
\end{comment}

\begin{comment}
The experimental setup should include all data --- parameters, etc. --- that would allow a person to repeat your experiments.
This will thus be the actual instantiation for each experiment of the general architecture described in Chapter~\ref{cha:architecture}.
\end{comment}

% The experiments conducted using the above-mentioned \acrshort{acr:gis} benchmark are divided into two approaches. The first approach, presented in \autoref{subsec:benchmarking-setup}, is intended to evaluate GeoGPT's ability to solve a variety of geospatial tasks. The second approach, presented in \autoref{subsec:prompt-quality-test-setup}, aims to uncover the importance of the quality of the initial user prompt. \Autosubsectionref{subsec:hardware-and-model-version} describes the hardware on which the experiments were executed, and the specific \acrshortpl{acr:llm} that were used.

This section will explain the concept and setup of the two experiments mentioned in the introduction of this chapter. \Autosectionref{subsec:benchmarking-setup} will describe the setup for the \acrshort{acr:gis} benchmarking experiments, while \autoref{subsec:prompt-quality-test-setup} will explain the setup for the prompt quality experiment. Results for the two experiments are presented in \autoref{tbl:test-results-quantitative} and \autoref{tbl:test-results-prompt-levels}, respectively. \Autosubsectionref{subsec:hardware-and-model-version} describes the hardware on which the experiments were executed, and the specific \acrshortpl{acr:llm} that were used.

\subsection[GIS Benchmark]{\acrshort{acr:gis} Benchmark}
\label{subsec:benchmarking-setup}

% In order to investigate how an \acrshort{acr:llm}-based \acrshort{acr:gis} agent most comfortably accesses geospatial data, a decision was made to include three different methods for data access in the experiments. The first method for data access is to have the files described in \autoref{sec:datasets} remain untouched. The files would be stored locally on the computer on which the experiments are conducted, and GeoGPT, which runs on the same computer, would be able to interact with the data through the code it generates. These files are made available in GeoGPT's working directory. The second method used is to load the data into a spatial \acrshort{acr:sql} database and provide the model with database schemas that can be used to generate queries. The datasets were uploaded to a Dockerized PostGIS database using QGIS's DB Manager plugin. The third method for data access is to use the \acrshort{acr:ogc} \acrshort{acr:api} Features standard. This method exposes the data stored in the PostGIS database through a web \acrshort{acr:api} that allows consumers of the \acrshort{acr:api} to download the data over \acrshort{acr:http} as GeoJSON.

The first experiment will measure the abilities of GeoGPT three agent types to produce correct answers, and will also measure cost and time taken to generate answers, and the agent's ability to produce similar answers consistently (repeatability). To do this, a benchmarking dataset was constructed. This is a set of 12 GIS-related questions with corresponding correct answers, and can be viewed in its entirety in \autoref{tbl:questions-quantitative}. Furthermore, as described in \autoref{sec:high-level-application-architecture}, GeoGPT features \textit{three} different agent types that access data in \textit{three} different ways. The \acrshort{acr:gis} benchmarking experiment will therefore also seek to compare the performance of these three agents on the same questions, having access to the same data. Each of the 12 questions will be asked three times per agent type. As there are three agent types (see \autoref{sec:agent-architecture}), the total number of test runs becomes the following:

$$12 \text{ questions} \cdot 3 \text{ agent types} \cdot 3 \text{ repetitions} = 108 \text{ tests}$$

The following sections, named \enquote{\nameref{subsubsec:outcome-evaluation}}, \enquote{\nameref{subsubsec:cost-and-duration}}, \enquote{\nameref{subsubsec:repeatability}}, will go into detail on the different ways that the results are evaluated.

\subsubsection{Outcome Evaluation}
\label{subsubsec:outcome-evaluation}

Each test run's GeoGPT-generated answer will be manually evaluated based on how well the question was answered, and this outcome will be annotated as one of the following: \textit{success}, \textit{partial success}, and \textit{failure}. \autoref{tbl:test-outcome-enum} shows the guidelines used when assigning outcome scores.

\begin{table}[htbp]

    \caption[Guidelines for evaluating outcome of tests]{Guidelines for evaluating outcome of tests. Test runs are evaluated as a \textit{success}, a \textit{partial success}, or a \textit{failure}.}
    \label{tbl:test-outcome-enum}
    \begin{tabularx}{0.9\textwidth}{p{3cm}X}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Outcome} & \textbf{Guideline}                                                                                                                                                                                  \\
        \midrule
        Success          & The question was answered correctly and little to no follow-up from the user was required to produce the desired outcome. No false assumptions were made by the system when answering the question. \\
        Partial Success  & Portions of the question were answered correctly or semi-correctly, and/or some follow-up from the user was required to guide the system toward the solution.                                       \\
        Failure          & The question was answered incorrectly answered and/or false assumptions were made by the system while attempting to answer the question.                                                            \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Cost and Duration}
\label{subsubsec:cost-and-duration}

The application is hooked up to LangChain AI's tracing system, \textit{LangSmith}.\footnote{\url{https://www.langchain.com/langsmith}} Apart from being a useful tool for debugging purposes, LangSmith provides a simple way to obtain detailed data on token and time usage for a particular run, as well as the total cost of the run, in American dollars.

Box plots will be used to compare these three metrics for the different agents. These box plots make it easy to compare the three models in terms of token usage and time taken to complete tasks. They follow the description for box plots found on Wikipedia.\footnote{\url{https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot.html}}\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot}} Box plots allow us to easily see where the 0th ($Q_0$), 25th ($Q_1$), 50th ($Q_2$), 75th ($Q_3$), and 100th ($Q_4$) percentiles of the datasets lie, as well as the dataset's outliers. Outliers are those data points fall outside 1.5 times interquartile range, that is, the distance between $Q_3$ and $Q_1$ in each direction.
% \Autosubsectionref{subsec:quantitative-results}, which presents the results of the benchmarking tests, will feature a subsection that contains three different box plots: \autoref{fig:duration-box-plot}, \autoref{fig:cost-box-plot}, and \autoref{fig:tokens-box-plot}. 

\subsubsection{Repeatability}
\label{subsubsec:repeatability}

Another aspect that the \acrshort{acr:gis} benchmarking experiment will try to evaluate is the consistency of the system, its ability to repeatedly provide an acceptable answer to the same user question. The annotated outcomes are encoded using the ordinal encoding presented \autoref{tbl:outcome-encoding}. A higher value indicates a better outcome. Using these encoded outcomes, standard deviations will calculated for each triplet of identical test samples (samples where the question and the agent type remained the same), which serve as a suitable measure for assessing repeatability.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption[Encodings for test outcomes]{Encodings for test outcomes. A higher value is synonymous with a better outcome.}
    \label{tbl:outcome-encoding}
    \begin{tabularx}{0.5\textwidth}{XX}

        \textbf{Outcome} & \textbf{Encoded Value} \\
        \midrule
        Success          & 2                      \\
        Partial Success  & 1                      \\
        Failure          & 0                      \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}


\subsection{Prompt Quality Experiment}
\label{subsec:prompt-quality-test-setup}

A second set of experiments are constructed to evaluate the importance of the initial question/prompt from the user. As stated in the \nameref{sec:background-and-motivation} chapter, part of the motivation for developing an \acrshort{acr:llm}-driven \acrshort{acr:gis} like GeoGPT is to make \acrshort{acr:gis} more accessible to non-experts. It should therefore be valuable to assess the extent to which a carefully constructed prompt by a \acrshort{acr:gis} expert can enhance the system's output.

For these experiments, the three hardest questions from the \acrshort{acr:gis} benchmarking experiment were picked. Then, for each of these three questions, a \textit{novice}-level and an \textit{expert}-level prompt was constructed. The novice-level prompt is as simple as possible, while the expert-level prompt is more elaborate and written as a step-by-step recipe for solving the problem.

\subsection{Hardware and Model Version}
\label{subsec:hardware-and-model-version}

All experiments were conducted on a Lenovo ThinkPad E490, which has an Intel{\textregistered} Core\texttrademark{} i7-8565U CPU @ 1.80GHz processor, 15.8 GB usable \acrshort{acr:ram}, and 256 GB \acrshort{acr:ssd} storage. Everything but the \acrshort{acr:llm} inference was executed locally. Text generation was done using OpenAI's Inference \acrshort{acr:api}.

It is worth noting that two slightly different models were used during testing. This is due the release of the \texttt{gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09} in mid-April. According to OpenAI, \enquote{this new model is better at math, logical reasoning, and coding} compared to \texttt{gpt-4-0125-preview},\footnote{OpenAI has a GitHub repository containing the code they use to evaluate their \glspl{acr:llm} and benchmark results for OpenAI models and reference models from other companies: \url{https://github.com/openai/simple-evals}.} which is the model that was for the first test runs. At \texttt{gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09}'s release, a decision was made to use this for the remaining experiments. The experiments that had already been conducted were not re-run due to time constraints and a confidence that these slight model upgrades would not significantly change the outcome of the experiments.


\section{Datasets}
\label{sec:datasets}

A total of eighteen datasets were used in the experiments, all downloaded from Geofabrik's website.\footnote{\url{https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/norway.html}} Geofabrik, which is German for \enquote{geo factory}, is a company that \enquote{extract, select, and process free geodata}. They have gathered data from OpenStreetMap and published them as a collection of shapefiles, dividing them into categories such as \enquote{places of worship}, \enquote{points of interest}, and \enquote{traffic}. Data can be downloaded for different regions of the world, and for experiments conducted in this thesis, data for Norway was used. \autoref{tbl:datasets} lists all datasets, along with short descriptions of their contents, and the number of features for each dataset. Common for all datasets is their \emph{fclass} attribute, which is short for \emph{feature class}. Some datasets have additional attributes, such as the \emph{maxspeed} attribute in the road data and the \emph{type} attribute in the building data. \autoref{fig:datasets-trondheim} shows a plot containing four selected datasets, constrained to a bounding box of Trondheim. This plot was created by GeoGPT.

\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:experimental-results}

\begin{comment}
Results should be clearly displayed and should provide a suitable representation of your results for the points you wish to make.
Graphs should be labelled in a legible font. If more than one result is displayed in the same graph, then these should be clearly marked.
Please choose carefully rather than presenting every result. Too much information is hard to read and often hides the key information you wish to present. Make use of statistical methods when presenting results, where possible to strengthen the results.
Further, the format of the presentation of results should be chosen based on what issues in the results you wish to highlight.
You may wish to present a subset in the experimental section and provide additional results in an appendix.
Point out specifics here but save the overall/general discussion to the Discussion chapter.
\end{comment}

\Autosubsectionref{subsec:quantitative-results} and \autoref{subsec:prompt-quality-test-results} will present the outcome of the experiments presented in \autoref{subsec:benchmarking-setup} and \autoref{subsec:prompt-quality-test-setup}, respectively. Graphs created for this chapter are created using Matplotlib,\footnote{\url{https://matplotlib.org/}} a Python library suitable for creating visualizations like bar charts, box plots, etc.


\subsection[GIS Benchmark --- Results]{\acrshort{acr:gis} Benchmark --- Results}
\label{subsec:quantitative-results}

\subsubsection{Outcome Evaluation}

\autoref{fig:outcome-distribution} displays a bar chart for the outcome distribution per agent. \autoref{fig:outcome-distribution} shows that the \acrshort{acr:ogc} \acrshort{acr:api} Features and Python agent have comparable results, but that the \acrshort{acr:sql}-based agent performs significantly better compared to the other two in terms of producing the desired outcome. The \acrshort{acr:sql} agent has a success rate of 69.4\% compared to the other two, which share a success rate of 38.9\%. Possible reasons for this are discussed in \autoref{sec:why-sql-better} in the \nameref{cha:discussion}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \caption[Outcome distribution between GeoGPT's different agent types]{Outcome distribution between GeoGPT's different agent types.

    \label{fig:outcome-distribution}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Cost and Duration}

\autoref{fig:duration-box-plot} displays a box plot with a logarithmic y-axis showing task durations across the different agent types. Here we can see that the \acrshort{acr:sql} agent spends the least amount of time per task. The \acrshort{acr:ogc} \acrshort{acr:api} Features agent has a slightly higher median and a few time-consuming outliers. The Python agent is the odd one out with a median of $\sim 82$ seconds, a $Q3 \sim 293$ seconds, and a $Q4 \sim 984$ seconds. The large gap to the other two agents it largely due to the Python agent's tendency to load large datasets into memory. For instance, when attempting the task of calculating the difference between the polygon outlining Oslo and water polygons, the Python agent used nearly 40 minutes on the entire task. $94\%$ of the time was spent executing the code presented in \autoref{code:python-oslo-water-diff}. The main reason for the long execution time is line 8, where the whole \texttt{osm\_landuse\_polygons.shp} dataset is loaded into memory. This dataset has a size of $\sim 1.4 \text{GB}$, and loading such amounts of data in this way is very time-consuming. The Python agent was the only agent with such issues because the \acrshort{acr:ogc} \acrshort{acr:api} Features agent is limited to 10,000 features per dataset, and the \acrshort{acr:sql} agent does not load the data into memory like the other agents do.

\autoref{fig:cost-and-tokens} shows box plots for token usage and cost per run. Naturally, these figures appear very similar, since prices for the input tokens and generated output tokens are fixed for the models used. According to OpenAI's webpages,\footnote{\url{https://openai.com/pricing}} they charge $\$10$ per million input tokens and $\$30$ per million output tokens for their \acrshort{acr:gpt}-4 Turbo model. From the results of the experiments, a ratio of approximately $10.7$ per million tokens --- either input \textit{or} output --- was calculated, which is closest to the input token price. This shows that a lot more input tokens were used than output tokens.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering

    \label{fig:cost-and-tokens}
\end{figure}

An observation that can be made from \autoref{fig:correlation-matrices} is that the correlation between duration and token usage is inconsistent across the agent types. The \acrshort{acr:ogc} \acrshort{acr:api} Features agent and \acrshort{acr:sql} agent have strong correlation between these metrics, but the Python agent has next to none. This supports the observation that, for the Python agent, code execution time, particularly the time spent on expensive imports, is likely the main contributor towards the total run time.

Another observation that can be made from the \autoref{fig:correlation-matrices} is the slight negative correlation between the encoded outcome and each of the following variables: token usage, duration, and total cost. This suggests that a task that takes longer to complete is likely to be more expensive in terms of token usage, and more likely to produce an undesirable outcome. Possible reasons as to why this is the case will be explored in \autoref{subsec:dead-ends} the \nameref{cha:discussion}.

\subsubsection{Repeatability}

\autoref{tbl:stddev-by-agent-type} shows the average standard deviation of the outcomes for each agent type, as well as the mean of these three standard deviations. These numbers indicate that there is a notable amount of inconsistency in GeoGPT's answers when task and agent type stays the same, on average deviating with more than a third of an outcome category (0.376 for the encoded values).

\subsubsection{Successful Responses}

% 6df94421-6c7c-470a-af8e-7013f3bc547f
\autoref{fig:glomma-counties-sql-successful} shows a successful response from GeoGPT's \acrshort{acr:sql} agent when asked how many counties the Glomma river runs through.\footnote{This run was not part of the results used for evaluation due to a bug in the \texttt{sql\_db\_query} tool that caused it to unnecessarily execute queries twice. GeoGPT's response would not be different had the bug not been present for the run, but it would have taken longer to complete.} As a final answer to the initial prompt it lists all four correct counties in a numbered list. \autoref{code:glomma-counties-sql} shows the code generated by GeoGPT for the second invocation of \texttt{sql\_db\_query}. The second invocation is nearly identical to the first one, but in the first invocation the geometry column was not included in the response (which the tool informs GeoGPT about), meaning GeoGPT was unable to add the results to the map. It therefore decided to run the query again, now making sure to include the geometry column in the query result, before adding the result to the map using \texttt{add\_geojson\_to\_map}. A follow-up message instructed GeoGPT to \enquote{Add Glomma to the map}, allowing for visual verification that the answer it gave was correct.

While setting a definitive answer to the question is difficult, the correct answer was set to about 100, assuming a 20-meter buffer around the line segments that make up the road, is used. In \autoref{code:python-munkegata-bbox} we can see how GeoGPT loads the road data around Munkegata in Trondheim, using an approximate bounding box to avoid getting roads named \enquote{Munkegata} in other cities. It then filters and saves the loaded data to only include features with name \texttt{== 'Munkegata'}. In the following code block (see \autoref{code:python-trees-count-munkegata}), GeoGPT gets the tree data by filtering the \texttt{osm\_natural\_points} dataset on the \texttt{fclass} attribute, before loading the road data for Munkegata from the subsequent code block, converting both datasets to a metric \acrshort{acr:crs}, creating a buffer around the road data, performing an intersection between the buffer, and finally printing the \texttt{tree\_count} to the standard output.

\subsubsection{Unsuccessful Responses}

While GeoGPT was able to get a lot of questions correct, it provided more or less unsuccessful answers at least once for all questions but one. \autoref{fig:python-high-speed-roads-unsuccessful} exemplifies a common mistake with GeoGPT, which will be a central topic in the \nameref{cha:discussion}. Here, the Python agent has failed to recognize that the road datasets it has available is in fact for the whole of Norway, not just Oslo. As \autoref{code:python-high-speed-unsuccessful} shows, the agent performs the correct analysis based on the assumptions it has already made, but the answer is far from what the user enquired.

\autoref{fig:oaf-geodesic-unsuccessful} shows an unsuccessful attempt from GeoGPT's \acrshort{acr:ogc} \acrshort{acr:api} Features agent to create a geodesic line between Oslo Airport Gardermoen and Bergen Airport Flesland. \autoref{code:query-collection-airports-no-results} shows GeoGPT's attempt to download a point feature representing \enquote{Oslo Airport}. It turns out that no such point feature exists, and only a polygonal feature in another dataset is available for the airport. The same is the case for Bergen Airport. GeoGPT made many attmpts at fetching point data for the airports, but of course none of them  returned any results.

Eventually, GeoGPT downloads a bunch of features from the \texttt{osm\_transport\_points} collection twice, names them \enquote{oslo\_airport.geojson} and \enquote{bergen\_airport.geojson}, and produces the nonsensical code displayed in \autoref{code:python-airports-desperate}, where it picks the first point feature in each collection and assumes that their coordinates are those of Oslo and Bergen. These two features actually correspond to are Rakkestad Airport and a bus stop on a road along Ofotfjorden in Nordland. In addition to this mistake, subsequent attempts at creating a geodesic line between the locations were unsuccessful.

\subsection{Prompt Quality Experiment --- Results}
\label{subsec:prompt-quality-test-results}

\autoref{fig:outcome-distribution-experience-levels} shows the outcomes of the experiments where the importance of the quality of the user's initial prompt was assessed. It is clear to see that \textit{expert}-level prompting significantly outperforms \textit{novice}-level prompting, the latter of which produced \textit{no} fully successful responses. It is worth noting, however, that the questions picked were the three hardest ones from the \acrshort{acr:gis} benchmarking experiment.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{levels_outcome_distribution_bar_chart.png}
    \caption[Outcome distribution for different levels of GIS experience]{Outcome distribution for different levels of GIS experience. Using novice-level prompting, GeoGPT failed to complete the tasks consistently, but using the more elaborate expert-level prompt, GeoGPT performed much better.}
    \label{fig:outcome-distribution-experience-levels}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:novice-vs-expert-munkegata-trees} compares the responses that GeoGPT's \acrshort{acr:ogc} \acrshort{acr:api} Features agent managed to produce for the different prompt levels on one of the tasks. The \textit{novice}-level prompt was as follows:

\begin{quote}
    \enquote{Could you count how many trees there are on Munkegata street in Trondheim?}
\end{quote}

\noindent The \textit{expert}-level prompt included a series of instructions:

\begin{quote}
    \enquote{1. List all datasets that could possibly include trees. \\
        2. Find the correct feature class and filter the relevant dataset to access tree data for Trondheim. Use a bounding box to reduce the number of trees to analyse. \\
        4. Fetch road data for Munkegata. Use a bounding box for Trondheim in case there are streets elsewhere named Munkegata. \\
        5. Convert both datasets to a suitable metric CRS and add a 20-meter buffer around the road data. \\
        6. Find all trees that lie within this buffer and count them. \\
        7. Present the findings with a map highlighting the roads and the trees.}
\end{quote}

\FloatBarrier

Using the novice-level prompt GeoGPT was unable to produce the correct outcome, and confidently answered that there are \enquote{approximately 6,915 trees on Munkegata street in Trondheim}, which is far from being true. When solving the task, GeoGPT made a series of oversights that lead to this result. First, it failed to take into account that there may be more than one street in the dataset named \enquote{Munkegata}, missing the important step of applying a bounding box filter to the query. A similar mistake was made when retrieving the tree data. Due to the upper limit of 10,000 features per query in the \acrshort{acr:api}, it's crucial to narrow down the query to ensure retrieval of all relevant features rather than just a subset. GeoGPT's query lacked a bounding box, resulting in a randomly distributed subset of 10,000 trees scattered across Norway. A third mistake occurred when GeoGPT calculated a bounding box around the retrieved road data instead of creating a buffer. The latter method would have produced a more accurate result. The bounding box that was created spanned from Trondheim to Oslo, thus including far more trees than was intended.

The expert-level prompt, on the other hand, provided the necessary guidance for GeoGPT for this specific task, steering it clear of the issues it encountered with the novice-level prompt. As OpenAI themselves stated, \enquote{some tasks are best specified as a sequence of steps}.\footnote{\url{https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/strategy-write-clear-instructions}} Furthermore, they say that writing explicit steps required to solve a task \enquote{makes it easier for the model to follow them}.
