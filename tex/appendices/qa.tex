    Steps:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Realize that new buildings should be secure against 200-year floods.
        \item Gather and load flood risk data and building point data.
        \item Ensure that both datasets are in the same coordinate reference system (CRS).
        \item Filter out the buildings that are located within the 200-year flood zone.
