\chapter{LangSmith}
\label{app:langsmith}

LangSmith\footnote{\url{https://www.langchain.com/langsmith} (last visited on \today)} is a DevOps platform that is part of the LangChain ecosystem. It allows the developer of \acrshort{acr:llm}-based applications to test, deploy, and monitor applications. LangSmith was used during both the development and testing of GeoGPT. \autoref{fig:langsmith-main} shows the main page for a LangSmith project, in this case the project that is hooked up to GeoGPT. This page gives a list of all of GeoGPT's runs, and metrics like latency, token usage, and total cost in dollars, for each run. This is where the metrics recorded in the experiments (see \autoref{tbl:test-results-quantitative}) were obtained.

\autoref{fig:langsmith-trace} shows the trace of a given run of GeoGPT. In the sidebar to the left, is a complete list of all the LangChain runnables that were invoked during the run. On its right, is an overview of the inputs and outputs of the runnable that is currently selected. This page is particularly useful for debugging purposes.
